Major Improvement Recommendations
Phase 1: Critical Fixes
✅ Make plugin synchronous - Handle async operations internally
✅ Fix hydration race conditions - Single merge and patch cycle
✅ Add comprehensive error handling - With optional error callbacks
✅ Implement proper external sync - Use adapter subscriptions correctly
✅ Add SSR guard at function start
Phase 2: Performance & Features
Per-bucket debouncing - More granular control
Change detection - Avoid unnecessary writes
Key namespacing - Prevent collisions and enable versioning
Store lifecycle integration - Handle $reset and cleanup
Phase 3: Developer Experience
Better type safety - Enforce mutual exclusivity at type level
Error observability - Logging and debugging hooks
Comprehensive testing - Critical missing piece
Documentation - Clear API and behavior documentation
Architectural Recommendation
The plugin should follow this flow:

Synchronous registration with deferred async hydration
Collect all bucket data → merge once → single patch
Set up subscriptions for mutations and external changes
Implement proper debouncing and change detection
Handle errors gracefully with user-defined error handlers
The current implementation has good foundational ideas but suffers from race conditions, performance issues, and incomplete error handling that could cause production problems.
